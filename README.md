Supplementary Material A: Detailed Model Architecture and Components (PDF file). This material provides the in-depth structural overview and mathematical details of the two main feature extraction components: the Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (MoTCN) and the https://github.com/pinepp/stall/blob/main/README.mdCausal Wavelet Transform (Causal WT).
    
Supplementary Material B: RML Algorithm Details (PDF file). This material provides the detailed workflow, equations (S1) and (S2), and the alternating process for the Related Incident Adaptation Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (RML) algorithm, covering both the Inner Loop and Outer Loop updates.
    
Supplementary Material C: Evaluation Details and Implementation Parameters (PDF file). This material contains the detailed formulation of the advanced interpretability metrics (AOPC and Cosine Similarity), the full summary of model hyperparameter settings, and the tables summarizing computational consumption (memory and latency).
    
Supplementary Material D: Detailed Qualitative and Interpretability Results (PDF file). This material includes additional qualitative and interpretive visualizations, specifically the t-SNE projection of the model's intermediate feature space (Fig. S1) and the comprehensive real stall flight test data curves (Fig. S2).
